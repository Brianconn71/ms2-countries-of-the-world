# Countries of the world

## Purpose

This web app was built for the purpose of my second milestone project at Code Institute.
I built this Website from scratch using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are also eements of jQuery and Bootstrap prevalent in the code.

I chose to do my project based on an quiz mainly as I have a deep love of quizzes myself and I liked the idea of challenging myself to make a quiz app.
I chose to do it based on the countries of the world and in particular the flags of the countries of the world. 
Ever since I was a young lad, I have always had a fascination with flags and with geography as a whole.
I wanted to take that keen interest I have in quizzes and geography to make a flags quiz as my project.

## Project Description

## Strategy

I created this project as a means of showcasing all that I have learnt so far in my journey towards being a full-stack developer at Code Institute. This is my second project and it showcases my knowledge of
HTML, CSS and Javascript along with some of the libraries including jQuery and bootstrap. It also showcases knowledge of various methods and functions in the JavaScript language and the dom.

This website should provide some fun light-hearted entertainment in the form of a quiz based on the flags of the world and other geographical data. I set up the website so as to be a "one-stop" shop. What I mean by this is that Users will also be able to find out information about different countries of the world using the search bar or by clicking on the continent links.
They can study for the quiz by using the links and the search bar to find out information on countries.

### Goals

* To show that I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

* To create an enjoyable Website/app that Users will love interacting with and want to keep coming back to beat there high score.

* To create a Website/app that will make Users tell there friends and family and to grow the user base.

* To allow Users to show off there skills and knowledge of the corld in a fun and enjoyable way.

* To allow new Users and returning Users to learn about countries of the world andd some information about the countries.

* To showcase a game that has differing scenarios based on score in the quiz.

### User Stories

* "I want to be anle to view and use the site at any and all screen sizes"

* "I want to understand what the site is about and easily manouver throughout the site."

* "I want to be able to search and find whatever country I am looking for"

* "I want to be able to start the game when I am fuly ready and I don't want it to start before I say so."

* "I want to be able to read the questions and answers easily and to be able to click on any answer I want."

## Scope

### Features

The website has one main page. This page will contain all the elements of my project except for the 404 page which is separate.

The header will have a bootstrap carousel with 5 images. A different image becomes active every 8 seconds. The header will also contain 2 main CTAs, Take our Quiz and Discover the world, these will be the first things a user sees on the page. The take our quiz button will be slightly brighter in color to the discover the world button as taing the quiz is the reason a user will come to the page and I want to make it slightly more prominent.

The next section on the page will be a search bar and button functionality to allow a user to find out more information about the various countries of the world. This will allow a user to "study" before taking the quiz or if they just want to learn some new information about a country then it will be a one stop shop for them. In the making of the site, I also envisioned young kids in primary scool who are just learning countries and capitals to use the site to expand their curiosity.

The quiz game section is the next section on the page and will encompass calling an api to dislay questions and 4 multiple choice answers, display a score to users and display their progress throughout the quiz with a progress bar and show them what question they are on out of 10. The quiz will display a start the quiz button which a user will click on in order to display the first question and start the quiz. At the end of the quiz a results container will show tell them congrats on finishing the quiz. It will also show them there final score and ask them if they would like to play the quiz again. A play again button will also appear on the results section which a user will click on in order to play the quiz again if they wish too.

The final section is the send a message section which will allow a user to send on their high score, make a general query or comment about the website or allow them to send on any error they have seen on the site or quiz. When they submit there message email.js will send an email to me and a new section will appear in place of the form which will thank the user for their message and assure them that we will get back to them ASAP.

The website will also have a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page with the logo for the site.

There will also be a footer fixed to the bottom of the page displaying social media icons and a trademark icon followed by my name.


### Future Features

Due to reasons outside of my control I was unable to add "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" modes to the quiz in the time frame that was alloted for this project. However, It is something that a future release of the quiz will have, Each quiz will have 10 questions and depending on how they do on a level, the chance to move up and take on a more challenging quiz will be offered to them. I think this would really appeal to people who want to expand there knowledge base and in particular to kids who are just learning about the world and want to continue to push there boundaries. 

## Structure

The website is split into 4 different sections on one index.html file. Each section has a different role to play in the look and feel of the site to the user.

It is important for the user to understand what the website is about when they land on the page. This is made apparent with the name of the site being countries of the world

## Skeleton

There are a lot of changes that were made to the site between inception of the idea and the final project. Initially, I had called it flags of the world and had a much different color theme and typography that the finished project.

In the end I made changes to the color theme and name and eventually decided to call the site countries of the world as I felt it better got the point across and appealed to a wider user base than just showing the different flags of countries.

The below wireframes are from the very beginning of the idea for the project and don't truly reflect the direction I ended up going eith o the site.
