## Purpose <a name="introduction"></a>

This web app was built for the purpose of my second milestone project at Code Institute.
I built this Website from scratch using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are also eements of jQuery and Bootstrap prevalent in the code.

I chose to do my project based on an quiz mainly as I have a deep love of quizzes myself and I liked the idea of challenging myself to make a quiz app.
I chose to do it based on the countries of the world and in particular the flags of the countries of the world. 


Ever since I was young, I have always had a fascination with countries and with geography as a whole.I wanted to take that keen interest I have in quizzes and geography to make a flags quiz as my project.

When I was young I had a globe that when a country was pressed on, it would tell you its name, capital etc. There was some quizzes too that were fun such as find the country and find the capital. I wanted to make my project a fun, easy going site that would appeal to people of al ages and that anyone could use to find out some more information about a country and take there knowledge to another level by taking the quiz.

# UX <a name="ux"></a>

## Project Description <a name="description"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

I created this project as a means of showcasing all that I have learnt so far in my journey towards being a full-stack developer at Code Institute. This is my second project and it showcases my knowledge of
HTML, CSS and Javascript along with some of the libraries including jQuery and bootstrap. It also showcases knowledge of various methods and functions in the JavaScript language and the dom.

This website should provide some fun light-hearted entertainment in the form of a quiz based on the countries of the world and other geographical data. I set up the website so as to be a "one-stop" shop. What I mean by this is that Users will also be able to find out information about different countries of the world using the search bar or by clicking on the continent button links.
They can study for the quiz by using the links and the search bar to find out information on countries.

### Goals <a name="goals"></a>

* To show that I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

* To create an enjoyable Website/app that Users will love interacting with and want to keep coming back to beat there high score.

* To create a Website/app that will make Users tell there friends and family and to grow the user base.

* To allow Users to show off there skills and knowledge of the corld in a fun and enjoyable way.

* To allow new Users and returning Users to learn about countries of the world andd some information about the countries.

* To showcase a game that has differing scenarios based on score in the quiz.

### User Stories <a name="user-stories"></a>

* "I want to be able to view and use the site at any and all screen sizes"

* "I want to understand what the site is about and easily manouver throughout the site."

* "I want to be able to search and find whatever country I am looking for"

* "I want to be able to start the game when I am fuly ready and I don't want it to start before I say so."

* "I want to be able to read the questions and answers easily and to be able to click on any answer I want."

* "I want to know wheter or not my answer was correct"

* "I want to be able to proceed to the next question at my own pace."

* "I want to be able to see my score."

* "I want to be able to play the quiz again when I have finished."

* "I want to be able to contact the site about any problems or issues I had with the game"

## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

### Features <a name="features"></a>

The website has one main page. This page will contain all the elements of my project except for the 404 page which is separate.

The header will have a bootstrap carousel with 5 images. A different image becomes active every 8 seconds. The header will also contain 2 main CTAs, Take our Quiz and Discover the world, these will be the first things a user sees on the page. The take our quiz button will be slightly brighter in color to the discover the world button as taing the quiz is the reason a user will come to the page and I want to make it slightly more prominent.

The next section on the page will be a search bar and button functionality to allow a user to find out more information about the various countries of the world. This will allow a user to "study" before taking the quiz or if they just want to learn some new information about a country then it will be a one stop shop for them. In the making of the site, I also envisioned young kids in primary scool who are just learning countries and capitals to use the site to expand their curiosity.

The quiz game section is the next section on the page and will encompass calling an api to dislay questions and 4 multiple choice answers, display a score to users and display their progress throughout the quiz with a progress bar and show them what question they are on out of 10. The quiz will display a start the quiz button which a user will click on in order to display the first question and start the quiz. At the end of the quiz a results container will show tell them congrats on finishing the quiz. It will also show them there final score and ask them if they would like to play the quiz again. A play again button will also appear on the results section which a user will click on in order to play the quiz again if they wish too.

The final section is the send a message section which will allow a user to send on their high score, make a general query or comment about the website or allow them to send on any error they have seen on the site or quiz. When they submit there message email.js will send an email to me and a new section will appear in place of the form which will thank the user for their message and assure them that we will get back to them ASAP.

The website will also have a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page with the logo for the site.

There will also be a footer fixed to the bottom of the page displaying social media icons and a trademark icon followed by my name.


### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

Due to reasons outside of my control I was unable to add "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" modes to the quiz in the time frame that was alloted for this project. However, It is something that a future release of the quiz will have, Each quiz will have 10 questions and depending on how they do on a level, the chance to move up and take on a more challenging quiz will be offered to them. I think this would really appeal to people who want to expand there knowledge base and in particular to kids who are just learning about the world and want to continue to push there boundaries. 

## Structure <a name="structure"></a>

The website is split into 4 different sections on one index.html file. Each section has a different role to play in the look and feel of the site to the user.

It is important for the user to understand what the website is about when they land on the page. This is made apparent with the name of the site being countries of the world

## Skeleton <a name="skeleton"></a>

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

[Website Wireframe PDF](https://github.com/Brianconn71/ms2-countries-of-the-world/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Flags%20of%20the%20world.pdf)

![Website Wireframe](https://github.com/Brianconn71/ms2-countries-of-the-world/blob/master/assets/wireframes/Flags%20of%20the%20world.png)

## Surface <a name="surface"></a>

There are a lot of changes that were made to the site between inception of the idea and the final project. Initially, I had called it flags of the world and had a much different color theme and typography that the finished project.

In the end I made changes to the color theme and name and eventually decided to call the site countries of the world as I felt it better got the point across and appealed to a wider user base than just showing the different flags of countries.

I also added a custom made 404 page with a basic paragraph of text that informs a user that a page does not exist and informs them to click on a button to return back to the homepage of the site.

I wanted to have a bright colored and easy to read site. Keeping consistency thoughout the project and maintaining consistent coloring on the buttons was important too.


### Colors <a name="colors"></a>

The main colors for the project were found using [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/c0bda5-cc978e-ed691d-261447-ff3864-262730). I spent time fiddling around with different color schemes but this was the most pleasing on the eye.

* #cdcdcd - this is the background color of the page, it is a very light grey and every color seemed to go very well with it.

* #261447 - this is thw color of the header and the footer. It is a dark purple color which makes the style of the fonts stand out.

* #fcecc9 - this is the font color in most places. It is a bright white/yellow color that is easier to see and read than a full on white color.

* #262730 - this is a dark black color. It is used for cont color in the search bar and in the quiz as it looks better and easier to read with a brighter colored background.

* #FF3864 - This is a striking red color. This color was used as the background on the country cards that come up when the user searches for a country or clicks on the continent buttons.

* #ED691D - This is a bright orange color. It is usd for the take our quiz cta on the header as well as the other buttons on the site. It was chosen as it stands out on the page and makes you notice the buttons. I wanted to have consistency on my site.

* rgb(196, 100, 45) -  This is a slightly darker less strinking orange. It was used only on the discover the world cta as I wanted it to be less appealing than the take the quiz cta.

* #C0BDA5 - This is the grey color that is used on the background og the contact form. I wanted to use light coloring on the page and this grey was light in color but also stood out just enough from the background color set for the entire site.

* #CC978E - This is the light red/brown color used for the quiz game. I wanted to have a neutral color for the quiz game that was light in color but stood out from the main background color of the site and I believe that this was achieved.

* #008000 - This is the dark green color that comes up on the quiz game answer if the user selects the right answer.

* #C21807 - This is the dark red color that somes up on the quiz game answer if the user selects the wrong answer.

### Images <a name="images"></a>

The only images used in the making of the website were used in the header in conjunction with the bootstrap carousel. These images were taken from [Unsplash](www.unsplash.com).

### Fonts <a name="fonts"></a>

Two fonts were used in the making of the site. The main-heading, logo font used on the site was [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppins&preview.text_type=custom) and the paragraph, sub-heading text used was [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=Raleway&preview.text_type=custom). The default font is sans-serif.

* Surface Duo

* iPhone 6/7/8 Plus

* Galaxy S9 + S10e

* iPhone X/Xs

* Pixel 2 XL

* 720p + 1080p screens

I also had family members and friends test out the site on their various devices/gagets and it was responsive and acting as it should on each device used.

### HTML Validation

[W3c Markup Validation tool](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test the site for HTML Validation. My site passed the HTML Validator test. Below is an image of the HTML validation test of my site:

![WebTest Validation](https://github.com/Brianconn71/ms2-countries-of-the-world/blob/master/assets/images/webtest.JPG)

### JavaScript Testing

I used [jshint.com](https://jshint.com/) to test my sites Javascript. My site passed the tests on JsHint


### User story testing

* "I want to be able to view and use the site at any and all screen sizes"
    * The site was tested on all browser engines and it is fully responsive on all browsers.
    * The site was tested on various screen sizes and was found to be responsive at every screen resolution down to 280px.
    * I gave permission to friends and family members to pay around with the site on various devices. No known issues were found in this testing.

* "I want to understand what the site is about and easily manouver throughout the site."
    * When a user lands on the site, There are two CTA's on the header that allow the user to interact with the site and manouver throughout the site.
    * The logo for the site appears in the top left which tells the user what the page is about.
    * By clicking on the logo, The user always stays on the index.html page.
    * When a user clicks on the Discover the world button they are taken to the country search section of the webpage which will allow the user to search for a country or click on a continent button to find out more information about the countries of that particular continent.
    * When a user clicks on the take our quiz button the user is taken to the quiz section of the website where they can start a new quiz by clicking the start the quiz button.
    * The user is able to close the section of the website relating to the country search and continent buttons by clicking on the close button placed at the top right of the country cards.
    * The user will click on the return to the top of the page arrow button at the bottom right of the page to easilt return to the top of the page whenever they scroll more than 50px from the top of the page.

* "I want to be able to search and find whatever country I am looking for"
    * The user can click on the search bar and type in the name of the country they want to search for. The search bar reacts to the input values being typed into the search bar and returns the relevant county that the user has searched for. Once the user has finished they may click the close button at the top right of the country card and it will disappear allowing them to make another search for a different country.
    * The country that the user has ssearched for will appear just below the search bar. If the user has spelled a country wrong a message will appear telling them that no country matches their search and that they need to watch their spelling.
    * If a user doesn't want to search for a particular country they can click on any of the continent buttons which will show the user the countries in tht particular continent. If the user doesn't want to see those countries anymore then they may click on the close button at the top right to close the display of the countries and then click on the return t top arrow at the bottom right of the page which will bring them back to the top of the page where they can better navigate the site again.

* "I want to be able to start the game when I am fully ready and I don't want it to start before I say so."
    * The quiz will not start until the user clicks on the start the quiz button, once clicked the quiz will begin and be displayed on the page.
    * The quiz has no timer so a user may start a game go away and come back later to coplete the quiz.

    * The questions appear very clearly in the quiz container, the writing is large enough and weighted enough to be able to read the questions easily. The answers display in grid format. When a user moves there mouse over an answer it increases its brightness by 20% which is a clear indicator to the user over which answer they are choosing. 
    * there is no timer so there is no rush in reading the questions or answers

* "I want to know whether or not my answer was correct"
    * When a user selects an answer there is a timeout action set for 1 second after the question has been answered, then the answer will either turn red or green. The answer choice will turn green if the user has selected the correct answer to the question and the answer choice will turn red if the user has chosen the wrong answer. This makes it very clear to the user if there answer was right or wrong. 

* "I want to be able to proceed to the next question automatically"
    * When the user selects an answer to a question there i a very brief wait until the question either turns red or green indicating either a right or wrong answer. Once it is known the game automatically proceeds to the next question.

The results container will contain a heading congratulating the user on completing the quiz, it will also show them their score and will ask them if they wish to play again. There will be a play again button displayed below that and when the user clicks on t, it will allow them to take the quiz again.

* "I want to be able to contact the site about any problems or issues I had with the game"
    * At the bottom of the page there will be a send us a message container which will display a form that the user can fill out in order to air any concerns or grievances they have about the site. They can also use this to tell us about how much they love the site and send us their high scores.
    * All of the fields are required so the user will have to input data into each field before the form can be sent.

## Content <a name="content"></a>

* The ideaa for my project came from an old globe game i remeembered having as a child. I wanted tto make a basic site that would appeal to people of all ages to help them to learn more about the countries of the world and then to test there knowledge in the quiz.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used throughout the project. The header carousel comes from the bootstrap carousel. Bootstrap cards are used to display the country information.

* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) was used as a source of troubleshooting.

* There was a lot of struggle involved with the quiz game. I spent a lot of time trying to get the questions and answers to appear on the dom from the api. The following two youtube videos were my main source of inspiration and guidance throughout the process. [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) was a very good source for helping me with styling, event listeners etc. 
while [james-quick-youtube-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdQGs62cR8&list=PLB6wlEeCDJ5Yyh6P2N6Q_9JijB6v4UejF&index=3&ab_channel=JamesQQuick) has a playlist on creating a quiz app with Javascript which was my main source of guidance throughout the coding of the quiz game on my site.

## Code Snippets <a name="code-snippets"></a>

* I wanted to create a return to the top of the page button so that when a user is reading information about a country that they can press the button to return back to the top, took code example from w3 schools [here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)

* I had some trouble figuring out how to link to different sections of the page when clicking on the cta so I found a solution [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2238368/how-to-make-a-button-redirect-to-another-page-using-jquery-or-just-javascript) 

* I didn't like the way the buttons were jumping to the different sections so I found a solution to the scrolling problem [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18071046/smooth-scroll-to-specific-div-on-click)

* [james-quick-youtube-series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZdQGs62cR8&list=PLB6wlEeCDJ5Yyh6P2N6Q_9JijB6v4UejF&index=3&ab_channel=JamesQQuick) &

# Acknowledgements <a name="acknowledgements"></a>

I would like to give a huge thanks to my mentor Adegbenga Adeye for his help throughout this project and throughout the course so far.

I would also like to say a huge thanks to the slack community, I wouldn't be where I am today without them.

I used this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23597708?start=0#content) from Brad Traversy and Florin Pop for some help, guidance and inspiration for my own project. I used it as a source of inspiration for my own project and at times to troubleshoot problems I had.
