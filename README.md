# Countries of the world

## Purpose

This web app was built for the purpose of my second milestone project at Code Institute.
I built this Website from scratch using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are also eements of jQuery and Bootstrap prevalent in the code.

I chose to do my project based on an quiz mainly as I have a deep love of quizzes myself and I liked the idea of challenging myself to make a quiz app.
I chose to do it based on the countries of the world and in particular the flags of the countries of the world. 
Ever since I was a young lad, I have always had a fascination with flags and with geography as a whole.
I wanted to take that keen interest I have in quizzes and geography to make a flags quiz as my project.

## Project Description

## Strategy

I created this project as a means of showcasing all that I have learnt so far in my journey towards being a full-stack developer at Code Institute. This is my second project and it showcases my knowledge of
HTML, CSS and Javascript along with some of the libraries including jQuery and bootstrap. It also showcases knowledge of various methods and functions in the JavaScript language and the dom.

This website should provide some fun light-hearted entertainment in the form of a quiz based on the flags of the world and other geographical data. I set up the website so as to be a "one-stop" shop. What I mean by this is that Users will also be able to find out information about different countries of the world using the search bar or by clicking on the continent links.
They can study for the quiz by using the links and the search bar to find out information on countries.

### Goals

* To show that I have a deep understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript

* To create an enjoyable Website/app that Users will love interacting with and want to keep coming back to beat there high score.

* To create a Website/app that will make Users tell there friends and family and to grow the user base.

* To allow Users to show off there skills and knowledge of the corld in a fun and enjoyable way.

* To allow new Users and returning Users to learn about countries of the world andd some information about the countries.

* To showcase a game that has differing scenarios based on score in the quiz.

### User Stories

# Acknowledgements

I would like to give a huge thanks to my mentor Adebeye for his help throughout this project and throughout the course so far.

I would also like to say a huge thanks to the slack community, I wouldn't be where I am today without them.

I used this [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23597708?start=0#content) from Brad Traversy and Florin Pop for some help, guidance and inspiration for my own project. I used it as a source of inspiration for my own project and at times to troubleshoot problems I had.
